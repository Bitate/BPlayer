2
00:00:03,289 --> 00:00:05,462
I'm Peppa Pig. (OINKS)

3
00:00:05,577 --> 00:00:07,970
This is my little brother, George. (OINKS)

4
00:00:08,193 --> 00:00:10,398
This is Mummy Pig. (OINKS)

5
00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:13,373
And this is Daddy Pig. (OINKS)

6
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,870
Daddy Loses His Glasses

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,525
(BOTH GIGGLE)

8
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:38,088
(LAUGHS)
Daddy Pig wears glasses.

9
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:42,813
He needs to wear glasses
to see clearly.

10
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:47,170
When Daddy pig wears his glasses
everything looks fine.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,892
But when Daddy Pig takes his glasses off,
he can't see things clearly.

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,962
Everything looks a bit soft and fuzzy.

13
00:00:59,402 --> 00:01:03,661
So, it is very important
that Daddy Pig knows where his glasses are.

14
00:01:08,183 --> 00:01:10,170
(OINKS) Hmm.

15
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:18,585
Sometimes, Daddy Pig loses his glasses.

16
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:23,003
Peppa, George, have you seen Daddy Pig's glasses?

17
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:24,892
He can't find them anywhere.

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,296
No, Mummy.

19
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:30,399
Peppa and George do not know
where Daddy Pig's glasses are.

20
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:32,495
Oh, dear!

21
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:35,225
Daddy Pig cannot see a thing without them

22
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:37,101
and it makes him very grumpy.

23
00:01:40,296 --> 00:01:44,053
Without his glasses on,
Daddy Pig cannot read his newspaper.

24
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:46,771
This is ridiculous!

25
00:01:46,937 --> 00:01:48,373
I can't see anything.

26
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:51,513
Somebody must have put my glasses somewhere.

27
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,042
Do you remember where you last put them, Daddy Pig?

28
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:58,250
When I don't wear them I always put them in my pocket.

29
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,418
But they aren't there now.

30
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,526
Daddy, can we help find your glasses?

31
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,031
Good idea, Peppa.

32
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,504
If you find them, Daddy will stop being so grumpy.

33
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:11,099
I'm not grumpy.

34
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:16,585
Peppa and George are looking for Daddy's glasses.

35
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:22,751
Peppa looks under the newspaper
but Daddy Pig's glasses are not there.

36
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:27,425
George looks on top of the television

37
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:31,245
but Daddy Pig's glasses are not there. Oh.

38
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:36,417
Let's look upstairs
in Mommy and Daddy's bedroom.

39
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:46,061
Peppa and George are looking
in Mummy and Daddy Pig's bedroom.

40
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:50,321
George, be careful
not to knock anything over.

41
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:51,668
(TING!)
Oh!

42
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:58,292
It's not funny.

43
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:07,587
Peppa looks under the pillows
but Daddy Pig's glasses are not there. Oh.

44
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:13,412
George looks in Daddy's slippers
but the glasses are not there, either.

45
00:03:13,937 --> 00:03:18,088
(SNIFFS / COUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

46
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:20,297
Let's look in the bathroom.

47
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:25,242
Peppa and George
are looking in the bathroom.

48
00:03:26,512 --> 00:03:29,217
The glasses are not in the bath...
Oh!

49
00:03:30,722 --> 00:03:33,653
The glasses are not in the toilet.
Oh.

50
00:03:34,154 --> 00:03:36,736
(SIGHS)
Oh. It's too difficult.

51
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:43,982
Peppa and George cannot find
Daddy Pig's glasses anywhere.

52
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:49,652
We've looked everywhere
but we can't find at Daddy's glasses.

53
00:03:49,652 --> 00:03:52,337
Oh, dear. Now what can we do?

54
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:55,652
I suppose I'll just have to learn to do without them.

55
00:03:56,657 --> 00:03:59,267
If I move slowly, I won't bump into things.

56
00:04:00,952 --> 00:04:02,202
There they are!

57
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:03,729
Daddy's glasses!

58
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,082
Daddy Pig! You were sitting on them all the time!

59
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:13,852
Silly Daddy!

60
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:18,764
I don't know how they got there.

61
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,843
I wonder how!

62
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:30,621
Well, you may have been a bit silly, Daddy Pig,

63
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:33,259
but at least you're not grumpy any more.

64
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,293
I was not grumpy.
